# Top Shelf Crusaders

## Purpose

Have you ever had random ingredients at home and felt too lazy to make a grocery store run. Of course, you have, that's where the Top Shelf Crusaders application steps in. Top Shelf allows users to input any number of ingredients and a list of recipes will be returned containing the ingredients searched.  Top Shelf aims to help its users to get creative in the kitchen by exposing them to new recipes. The site also features a nutritional chart for more conscious eaters.
